Regularity and anomaly detection program.

Each data set contains a series of seemingly random series of numbers. However, there are hidden regularities there.
There are two types of irregularities: outM and outS.
The files have the name:
out{M|S}-{0|1}-{100|500|1000}-{1|2|3|5|10}-{1|2|3}.dat.

The written software evaluates the data (lines of the input file) one after the other and immediately determines the anomaly positions.

The processing is similar to that of a neural network.
